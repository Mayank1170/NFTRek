# NFTRek üì∏üåç

A fun location-based NFT minting app where you can capture photos and mint them as NFTs with your geographical coordinates embedded!

## What is NFTRek?

## Features

- üì∏ **Camera Integration** - Capture photos directly in the app
- üåç **Automatic Geolocation** - Your location gets embedded in the NFT metadata  
- ‚ö° **Compressed NFTs** - Cheaper minting on Solana blockchain
- üì± **Mobile Friendly** - Works great on phones and tablets
- üé® **Fun UI** - Simpsons-inspired design that's actually enjoyable to use
- üîó **Multi-Wallet Support** - Connect with Phantom, Solflare, and more

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nftrek.git
   cd nftrek
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your Helius API key to .env.local
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash

   ```

5. **Open http://localhost:3000** and start minting!

## Required Environment Variables

You'll need at least one API key:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your Helius RPC endpoint (required for minting)

Optional but recommended:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_STORAGE_KEY` - For reliable image hosting

2. Allow location access when prompted
3. Take a photo using the in-app camera
4. Hit "Mint NFT" and we'll handle the rest!

Your NFT will include:
- Your captured image
- Exact coordinates (latitude/longitude)  
- City/location name
- Timestamp of when it was minted
